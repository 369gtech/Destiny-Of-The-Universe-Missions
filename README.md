# Destiny Of The Universe Missions

Welcome to Destiny Of The Universe Alpha Missions which are a way for players to earn while they battle. Missions once started are informative and can last from a couple of minutes to 2 Weeks. This is going to be another opportunity for players to earn at the same time they are battling in the game. If your a player you would definitely be into buying land and special multi-mission nft's so you can do more than one mission to layer your earnings capacity.

Destiny Of The Universe Alpha Missions will include;

<ul>
  <li>Daily Missions</li>
  <p></p>
  <p>Daily Missions are part of the daily battle rewards where if a player completes all the tasks required will earn loot box rewards depending on your league status. The rewards you could potentially earn are reward nft's, promotional nft's and in game currency. You will also be able to earn battle shares, so if you win your battles you will receive battle shares which are accumulated and rewarded at the end of the day. One last thing, we are going to give players an alternative way to earn daily rewards with an exclusive mission nft staked in your comic book where you can just do the exclusive missions to do the daily rewards rather than having to complete the battle tasks.</p>
  <li>End Of Season Reward Missions</li>
  <p></p>
  <p>End Of Season Missions are part of the rewards that are earnt by a player over 2 weeks which includes their power rating, league status and completing Daily Missions where you could potentially earn a lot of reward nft's, promotional nft's and in game currency. We will include other special options as the game expands like the Time Line War Missions where you can double your rewards if you complete all the tasks required over the 2 weeks.</p>

We will go into more details as we get closer to the opening of the game with special land give aways for the lucky few who get into the game early. Just remember every game may have separate missions and all missions associated with monoGames in terms of the rewards of monoGames Token and nftcryptomix Token will source their reward from the daily tokenomics of the game. There will be a shares point system and at the end of the day your shares while doing missions for that particular day is tallied and then the daily air drop which pans over five years allocated daily is divided and distributed to all share holders at the end of that 24 hour period. These shares are zeroed at the end of the 24 hour period and you will need to do a new set of missions for the new 24 hour period to earn the new daily rewards. If missions last longer than a day their is a likely hood that you will earn more shares and if there is any issue with longer missions and earning capacity the monoGames Team will look into changing the distribution so we have a fair game.
