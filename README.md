# Destiny Of The Universe Missions

Welcome to Destiny Of The Universe Missions which are a way for players to earn while they battle. Missions once started are informative and can last from a couple of minutes to 2 Weeks. This is going to be another opportunity for players to earn at the same time they are battling in the game. If your a player you would definitely be into buying land and special multi-mission NFT's so you can do more than one mission to layer your earnings capacity.

The rewards you could potentially earn are reward NFT's, promotional NFT's and in game currency.

<p>There is a bigger picture for the Sun, Eclipse and Moon Alliance's when the game moves into expansion mode which will make the game very interesting as Alliances try to win the Star Trophy to be the Leader Of The Galactic Alliance. Lots of rewards for the winning faction(s).
 
We will go into more details with missions in monoGames as we get closer to the opening of Destiny Of The Universe Game with special land giveaways for the lucky few who get into the game early. There will be a shares point system when completing missions and at the end of the day, your shares are tallied and then you will receive those rewards. These shares points are zeroed at the end of the 24 hour period and you will need to do a new set of missions for the new 24 hour period to earn the new daily rewards. If missions last longer than a day there is a likelihood that you will earn more shares and if there is any issue with longer missions and earning capacity the monoGames Team will look into changing the distribution so we have a fair game.
